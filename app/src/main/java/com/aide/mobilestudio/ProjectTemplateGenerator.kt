#
#   ABOUT THIS SCRIPT
#   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   MobileStudio runs Gradle *on-device*, inside an Android application's
#   private, `noexec`-mounted `/data` partition. That environment is
#   fundamentally hostile to a normal JVM launch:
#
#     - `/data/data/<pkg>/...` is typically mounted `noexec`, so the shared
#       objects that make up a JDK (`libjvm.so`, `libjli.so`, ...) cannot be
#       `dlopen()`-ed from disk in the ordinary way. MobileStudio's native
#       launcher (`libgradle_exec.so` / "NativeExec") works around this via
#       `memfd_create()` + `fexecve()`, loading the JVM into an anonymous,
#       executable memory-backed file descriptor instead of executing the
#       on-disk path directly.
#     - The bundled JDK is a custom on-device build (see the JDK/Android
#       port notes referenced in this project), cross-compiled against a
#       specific Bionic libc version. If the JDK build's target API level
#       does not match the *running* device's Bionic, dynamic symbol
#       resolution can fail at JVM startup — historically surfacing as
#       `dlopen` failures resolving `_ZN6Thread12_thr_currentE`, or as
#       `no known VMs. (check for corrupt jvm.cfg file)` even when the
#       actual `jvm.cfg` is present and well-formed.
#     - SELinux policy on stock Android further restricts what a
#       third-party app is allowed to execute, map executable, or ptrace,
#       which shapes several of the workarounds below.
#     - The Kotlin compiler bundled with MobileStudio requires a DEX-level
#       patch to bypass Hidden API restrictions
#       (`ConcurrentLongObjectHashMap.<clinit>` / `sun.misc.Unsafe.getAndAddInt`)
#       before it can run under the on-device DEX/D8 pipeline.
#
#   None of the above is fixable from a shell script — those are toolchain
#   and native-launcher concerns. What *this* script can do is:
#
#     1. Find a working JDK across every location MobileStudio has ever
#        installed one to (current, legacy, and shim layouts), instead of
#        assuming a single fixed path.
#     2. Fail loudly, early, and with actionable diagnostics rather than
#        letting Gradle itself produce an opaque JVM crash log.
#     3. Provide a `--doctor` mode that walks through the known Android
#        on-device-JVM failure signatures (see above) and tells the user
#        which one they're most likely hitting, based on what's actually
#        on disk and in the environment.
#     4. Avoid stomping on concurrent Gradle daemon invocations (MobileStudio
#        can trigger a build from more than one UI surface) via a simple
#        advisory lock.
#     5. Keep every destructive or environment-mutating action optional,
#        logged, and reversible, since this runs inside a user's IDE data
#        directory on their personal device.
#
#   This file is intentionally verbose. On a resource-constrained mobile
#   device, a clear error message that survives being copy-pasted into a
#   GitHub issue or emailed to limsemin17@gmail.com is worth far more than
#   a terse script that fails silently.

# ==============================================================================
#
# Four severities: DEBUG < INFO < WARN < ERROR. Everything at or above the
# configured threshold is written to both stderr (for the interactive/
# ADB-shell case) and a rotating log file under the app's files directory
# (for the "user reports a build failure from inside the IDE UI, with no
# terminal attached" case, which is the common case on a phone).
#
# Design notes:
#   - No external dependencies: pure POSIX `sh` builtins plus `date`.
#   - Color is auto-disabled when stderr is not a TTY, when MS_NO_COLOR=1,
#     or when the shell lacks `tput` (Android's `/system/bin/sh` sometimes
#     does).
#   - Log rotation is simple size-based rename-on-exceed, not time-based;
#     time-based rotation needs a cron-like trigger this script doesn't
#     have, and size-based is enough to keep a phone's limited storage from
#     filling with debug logs from a long-lived IDE session.

#   SECTION 6: COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENT PARSING
# ==============================================================================
#
# This script accepts a small set of launcher-level flags of its own (all
# prefixed to avoid ever colliding with a real Gradle task name or CLI
# flag), and forwards everything else untouched to Gradle. Launcher flags
# are stripped before the remainder is handed to GradleWrapperMain, so
# `./gradlew --verbose assembleDebug` runs `assembleDebug` verbosely
# rather than passing the literal string `--verbose` through to Gradle
# (which would fail, since Gradle spells its own verbose flag `-i`/
# `--info`, not `--verbose`).
#
# Recognized launcher flags:
#   --verbose, -v            Enable DEBUG-level logging to stderr + log file
#   --quiet, -q               Suppress INFO-level stderr output (log file
#                              still receives everything at the configured
#                              threshold)
#   --debug                   Alias for --verbose (kept for muscle-memory
#                              compatibility with `gradle --debug`, even
#                              though it does not enable Gradle's own
#                              --debug flag — that still needs to be passed
#                              explicitly if desired, since it is extremely
#                              verbose and rarely what's wanted by default)
#   --no-color                 Disable ANSI color in launcher log output
#                              (Gradle's own output color is unaffected)

Launcher options (consumed by this script, not forwarded to Gradle):
  -v, --verbose          Verbose launcher logging (DEBUG level)
  -q, --quiet            Suppress non-warning launcher output
      --debug            Alias for --verbose
      --no-color         Disable ANSI colors in launcher output
      --no-daemon        Force the Gradle daemon off for this run
      --daemon           Force the Gradle daemon on for this run
      --jdk <path>       Use a specific JDK root instead of autodetecting
      --clean-tmp        Clear the launcher tmp dir before starting
      --doctor           Diagnose the on-device JVM environment and exit
      --show-config      Print resolved configuration and exit
      --offline          Force Gradle's --offline mode
      --retry <n>        Retry a failed Gradle invocation up to n times
  -h, --help             Show this help text and exit
      --version          Show launcher version and exit
  --                      Stop parsing launcher options; forward the rest

Everything not recognized above is forwarded to the Gradle Wrapper
unchanged, in order, e.g.:

  gradlew --verbose assembleDebug --stacktrace

runs the launcher verbosely, then hands `assembleDebug --stacktrace` to
Gradle exactly as `./gradlew assembleDebug --stacktrace` would.

Configuration can also be set persistently via a `mobilestudio.properties`
file in either ${'$'}GRADLE_USER_HOME or the project root — see --show-config
for the list of recognized keys and their current effective values.

# ms_parse_args: populates the MS_* runtime variables from argv, and

# ${'$'}MS_GRADLE_ARGS_QUOTED. POSIX sh has no arrays, so a naive accumulator
# (a plain space- or newline-joined string, later re-split with an
# unquoted `${'$'}(...)`) would still be re-split on every IFS character
# inside each argument when it's expanded — silently breaking any
# argument containing a space, e.g. a quoted `-Pmessage="hello world"`
# would arrive at Gradle as two separate arguments. Instead, each
# argument is single-quote-escaped as it's appended (any embedded `'` is
# replaced with `'\''`, the standard POSIX-shell escape for "close quote,
# literal quote, reopen quote"), so that later doing
# `eval set -- ${'$'}MS_GRADLE_ARGS_QUOTED` reconstructs the exact original
# argument list — spaces, quotes, and all — as real positional
# parameters, not a re-split string.

#   SECTION 8: JDK / TOOLCHAIN DISCOVERY
# ==============================================================================
#
# MobileStudio has shipped its on-device JDK under several different
# directory layouts over the project's history (current, legacy
# JreGradleInstaller-era, and "shim" compatibility layouts), across two
# JDK major versions (17 and 21), under two possible app-data mount
# points (`/data/data/...` and `/data/user/0/...`), and — for users who
# sideload or test a self-built JDK via Termux rather than through the
# in-app installer — a handful of common Termux-adjacent locations as
# well.
#
# JDK 17 is currently the *recommended* toolchain (Gradle 8.2 / JDK 17 is
# the supported combination as of this writing); JDK 21 support is
# tracked separately and has known issues on-device (see --doctor for
# specifics). Detection therefore prefers a JDK 17 install over a JDK 21
# install when both are present, unless MS_PREFER_LEGACY_JDK reverses
# that (kept as an escape hatch, not because JDK 21 is "legacy" — the
# name refers to the *directory layout* preference, not the JDK version
# preference, and is intentionally decoupled from it).
#
# Detection order is expressed as a flat, ordered list of candidate
# JAVA_HOME roots rather than nested if/elif, so adding a future layout
# is a one-line change to a list, not a restructuring of control flow.

#   SECTION 9: JDK VALIDATION
# ==============================================================================
#
# Finding *a* `bin/java` is necessary but not sufficient on this platform.
# Two failure modes have been observed with on-device JDK builds that
# pass the SECTION 8 existence check but still cannot run Gradle:
#
#   (a) "no known VMs. (check for corrupt jvm.cfg file)" — this is
#       produced by the JDK launcher when `lib/jvm.cfg` is missing, empty,
#       or lists a `-server`/`-client` variant whose corresponding
#       `lib/server/libjvm.so` (or `lib/client/libjvm.so`) is not actually
#       present. Because MobileStudio's on-device JDK builds are
#       server-JVM-only (see the configure-script notes referenced by
#       this project), the *client* variant is expected to be absent —
#       only a missing *server* variant is an actual problem.
#
#   (b) A dlopen failure resolving a Bionic-libc-provided symbol such as
#       `_ZN6Thread12_thr_currentE` when the native launcher tries to
#       load `libjvm.so` — this indicates the JDK build's target Bionic
#       API level does not match the device's actual Bionic, and is a
#       toolchain/rebuild problem this script cannot fix, but *can*
#       detect early (by checking `jvm.cfg` and `libjvm.so` are at least
#       *present and correctly named*) and report clearly instead of
#       letting it surface as an opaque native crash mid-build.
#
# MS_STRICT_JDK_VALIDATION=1 (the default) performs these checks and
# aborts early with a specific, actionable message. Setting it to 0
# skips straight to invoking Gradle — useful if a user's setup trips a
# false positive here (e.g. a nonstandard JDK layout) and they'd rather
# see Gradle's own error than this script's.

  This is a guided check, not a guarantee — a JVM startup failure caused
  by a Bionic ABI/symbol mismatch between the on-device JDK build and
  this specific device cannot be fully confirmed without actually
  attempting to launch the JVM (which running a real build will do).

  If every check above passes and a build still fails at JVM startup,
  capture the exact error text and the JAVA_VERSION reported above, and
  report it via GitHub Issues or limsemin17@gmail.com — the project
  tracks known-failing (device Bionic version, JDK build target) pairs
  to prioritize which toolchain rebuilds are needed next.

# project: a transient failure to acquire the native `noexec` workaround
# (memfd_create returning EMFILE under memory pressure, or a brief
# SELinux denial race during app startup) that succeeds on a second
# attempt without any change to the build itself. MS_RETRY_COUNT defaults
# to 1 (i.e. no retry) precisely because retrying a *real* build failure
# (a compile error, a failing test) is never useful and would only slow
# down the feedback loop; users working on toolchain bring-up who expect
# transient native-launch flakiness can raise it explicitly.

            NDK Clang/CMake/Ninja toolchain for arm64-v8a.

              (Native Lua 5.4.9 VM + LÖVE-compatible runtime)
            - app/src/main/assets/game.lua is used when building a standalone APK (LuaJ)

            ## LÖVE callbacks supported
            - love.load() / love.update(dt) / love.draw()
            - love.touchpressed/released/moved, love.mousepressed/released/moved
            - love.keypressed/keyreleased

            ## Controls
            - Touch screen to interact (see main.lua)

            ## Build
            Run assembleDebug from MobileStudio. No NDK required.

            Vulkan game project generated by MobileStudio.

            ## How it works
            - Kotlin Activity provides Android window surface
            - C++ Vulkan renderer: instance → surface → device → swapchain → pipeline → draw
            - Spinning colored triangle with touch rotation
            - Edit app/src/main/cpp/vulkan_renderer.cpp to change the renderer

            ## Controls
            - Drag to rotate the triangle

            ## Build
            Run assembleDebug from MobileStudio. Requires NDK + Vulkan-capable device.
